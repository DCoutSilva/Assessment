# Assessment
  Code developed for an assessment for a job opening and for training skills
  
  A lot can be improved
  
  
 # Backend
  Backend inside assessment folder, developed using Java, SpringBoot, MongoDB
  to run just start you MongoDB Server on default port 27017, clone the repository and run "mvn spring-boot:run"
  
  #Frontend
    Frontend code is within assessmt-front folder, I tried developing in react, but I have no experience with it so it does not work #sorry
    
   The file openapi.yaml has the swagger describing the api endpoints
   
   It was also my first experience using a non-relational database, I think I did it pretty good but I know it could be better (for example, an update in the accounts is not reflected in the list of accounts in a user)
   
   Thank you for the oportunity to practice my skills. Hope to hear from your company in a near future.
